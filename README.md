# About me

I am always **positive, love learning new things, and can quickly grasp various concepts**. I have a diverse background in music, art, and creative thinking. But at the same time, I have **completed a science and mathematics education**, and I have skills in **programming and proficient computer usage**. Additionally, I have a keen interest in continuously developing skills and learning about new technologies.

I graduated with a **Bachelor's degree from Silpakorn University**, Faculty of Music , majoring in Jazz Vocal with **First Class Honors**. I have conducted research on the analysis of jazz songs, chord progressions, applying mathematics.

Now, I wish to exploit my research and analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I am **studying the use of various tools for manual testing** and have been through many online courses on the Internet.

I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal â€” **to become a senior software tester in 3 years, and to gain experience to improve my skills to automated software tester** .
